# üìù Todo Application (Spring Boot)

A simple **Todo Management REST API** built using **Spring Boot** that lets users manage their daily tasks efficiently.  
This project demonstrates the use of **Spring Boot**, **Spring Data JPA**, and **RESTful API design principles** with a clear 3-layered architecture.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Configuration

  1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository
        *bash
        git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TodoApplicationBySpringBoot.git
        cd TodoApplicationBySpringBoot

  2Ô∏è‚É£ Configure the Database
        In the file:
        open => src/main/resources/application.properties

  Use the following template (edit as needed for your database):

    # = DataSource Configuration
    # ===============================
        spring.datasource.url=jdbc:YOUR_DB_TYPE://localhost:YOUR_PORT/YOUR_DB_NAME
        spring.datasource.username=YOUR_USERNAME
        spring.datasource.password=YOUR_PASSWORD

    # Example (PostgreSQL)
        spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/todo_db
    
    # = JPA / Hibernate
    # ===============================
        spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL8Dialect
        
  3Ô∏è‚É£ Create a SECRET for JWT Token creation and validations

      MY_SECRET = YOUR SECRET KEY FOR JWT TOKEN MUST BE GREATER THAN 256 BITES 

  BEST PRACTICE => USE A ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE 

    TO REFER   => .env.example file and create a variables in the environment variables 
  
  Build & Run the Application
      mvn clean install
      mvn spring-boot:run
      or run the main class TodoApplication.java directly from your IDE.
